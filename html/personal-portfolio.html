                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>Hello! My name is Jaycob Hoffman. I am an aspiring software developer seeking a remote entry-level position or internship 
                to gain experience in the industry. I am particularly interested in AI within a software development context 
                and how we as developers can harness it to our advantage. I aim to be a part of 
                the new generation of young professionals in the software development field, enhancing companies' 
                ability to create, market, and sell products through elevated, innovative, and efficient business technology.

            <h2>About me</h2>

            <section class="main-section">
                <h3>Background</h3>

                <p>While I have professed a strong interest in software development since high school, 
                I originally chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in graphic and UX design at Southern New Hampshire University. 
                While progressing in my degree, I worked for Jayde & Rose, a small business which sold handmade crochet art. 
                Additionally, I began building my own small business, Wildest Dreams, designing and selling stickers. 
                Through these experiences, I established a strong foundation of skills in graphic design, web design, 
                user experience, and online marketing, many of which are transferable to software development 
                (e.g., frontend development, SEO, responsive design, typography, and color theory). 
                In total, I have over 2 years of experience in the IT industry.

                <br>
                <br>

                I withdrew from Southern New Hampshire University in March of 2024 with plans to resume my higher education 
                at a later date. Since then, I have been focusing on my passion for software development, 
                having taken a diverse array of courses through Codecademy. From March of 2024 to April of 2024 alone, 
                I completed over 45 hours of coursework through the platform, acquiring many of the technical 
                skills I noted above. However, I intend to continue taking courses through Codecademy, as I am current doing. 
                I am a disciplined, independent learner who is constantly upskilling, sharpening my 
                current skills while simultaneously obtaining new ones.</p>

                    Like in the startup, I hope to gain a strong repertoire as a respected individual on my team, 
                    being who my colleagues look to for making pivotal development decisions.</li>
                    <li><b>For the next ten years:</b> Meanwhile, I wish to further my education, concentrating specifically on AI and its roles in shaping 
                    the software development industry of the future. Within the next ten years, I aim to become a leader in the AI-related
                    matters of my company's business tech, developing the AI that powers advanced user search functions,
